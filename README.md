Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of houses based on various features, such as the number of rooms, the size of the property, the location, etc. We use a dataset that contains information about various houses and their prices to train and test our model.

Data
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle and contains information on various features of houses, such as number of rooms, location, property size, etc. The dataset can be found here.

Methodology
We use Python programming language and various libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc., to preprocess the data, build and train our machine learning models, and evaluate their performance. We employ various algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to build our predictive models and select the best one based on performance metrics.

Results
Our best model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting the prices of houses, which is a significant improvement over the baseline model. We also conducted feature importance analysis to identify the most significant features in predicting the house prices.

Installation
To run this project on your local machine, you need to have Python 3.x installed, along with the required libraries, which can be installed by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the project, execute the following command:

css
Copy code
python main.py
This will preprocess the data, train and test the model, and generate the output file with the predicted prices.
